<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><font size="+3"> You see, in art, there needs to be an equilibrim between thought and vision. A masterpiece would contain thought after seeing it, and beauty in the eyes. A boring painting would be a painting that lies only in the eyes. <br> <br> Modern art lies on the exact opposite spectrum. Modern art would be a painting that lies only in thought, which is why modern art is so bad, is because it is so unexplainable that you just have to make up everything in your mind to fill the gaps, which in some cases you can't even do because there are no visuals. The Mona Lisa, a masterpiece, has both beauty in shading, and a testament to brush techniques, also has a touch of obscurity. Such as, why the woman is smiling and who she is. A painting of a house, is boring because there is no meaning to the painting, simply a house that is pleasing to the eye. A painting of a piece of bread has no meaning nor does it have beauty to the eyes so it is therefore, modern art. <br> <br>"If you make a set of art and call it something abstract like "A drop in a forest" or something, and you never make any more art again, you can sell that set of paintings for alot of money."  Actually, the reason why modern art sells for so much is because of the presentation. Any old dumbo can pick up a banana and duct tape it to the wall, but if you put that banana in a golden frame and you present it in front of billionaires, then of course more people will want to buy it even though they have no idea what it is. There is a primal instinct in your body that says, "If it is fancy and costs a lot, people must want it. If people want it, then I want it too, therefore I will buy it" you see, with modern art no one can tell the value of a painting just by looking at it. It's either worth 5 million dollars or nothing. With classical pieces, the value of a piece is easily determinable by the techniques used, the colors, scenery, size, lighting, and proportionality.<br> <br> A sane person that finds no meaning in modern art is "shamed" into believing that he does not have the open mindedness of a professional in the field, which is utterly ridiculous because there is no professional in the field of modern art. In conclusion, the plague of modern art is killing talent and welcoming lazy money launderers onto the scene. </font></p>
